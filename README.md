# Weather App

The Weather App is a Python-based web application that provides real-time weather information for a given city. It uses the Weatherstack API to fetch weather data and offers a user-friendly interface for users to access weather details easily.

## Folder Structure

The project has the following folder structure:

- `app.py`: The main Python script for the Weather App.
- `templates/`: This directory contains HTML templates for the app's user interface.
  - `index.html`: The initial page where users enter a city name.
  - `weather.html`: The page displaying weather details.

## Features

- Real-time weather data retrieval
- Display of temperature, humidity, and weather conditions
- Graceful error handling for incorrect input and network issues
- User-friendly and interactive design
